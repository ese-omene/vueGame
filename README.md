# Board Games #

## Why so many board games :question: ##

I tend to like to leave evidence of my train of thoughts. :thought_balloon: 
Usually the comments, but this time I decided to use the README.

## [First Attempt](https://github.com/ese-omene/vueGame/board.html) ##

### :cupid: Cupid shuffle :cupid: ###

Using resources on the vue.js documentation, I was able to implement a shuffle functionality for my puzzle.
My inital idea was to create a slider type puzzle, so this was my attempt to figure out how to move the pieces.

I went with an array after some in class discussions.

## [Second Attempt](https://github.com/ese-omene/vueGame/boardgame.html) ##

### :rainbow: Taste the Rainbow ###

The second iteration added a splash of color. Using the same shuffle from the first puzzle, now the user has to attempt to change the board from
*"red, yellow, blue, green" to "green, blue, yellow, red".*

## [Third Attempt](https://github.com/ese-omene/vueGame/boardgame2.html) ##

### Color Changer :carousel_horse: ###

So ultimately I wanted a puzzle board and puzzle pieces.  This version saw the implementation of 'pieces' in the form of buttons.
I struggled with the interaction between the puzzle board and the puzzle pieces.  This iteration challenged me to figure out how to change
the colors of the puzzle board because I knew I wanted to be able to identify which place on the board the user was going to place the piece.

## [Fourth Attempt](https://github.com/ese-omene/vueGame/boardgame3.html) ##

### :dancers: Let's get active! ###

Fourth and final (for this assignment at least) attempt I was able to pull together pieces of what I have learned along the way.
There is now an active class to know when a piece on the board is being selected.  Then when the matching 'button' or piece is selected there is a notification, and when the wrong one is selected the user is notified. 


Still a long way from where I had envisions, but progress has been made. 

### References  :pencil2: :page_with_curl: ###

I mainly used the Vue.js documentations.  The reference for matching the arrays is found in the comments of the code where it was used.
